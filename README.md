# Classification
In machine learning, classication is the problem of identifying to which of a set
of categories, a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data
containing observations whose category membership is known.

# K-NN
In KNN classication, the output is a class membership. An object is classied
by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class
most common among its k nearest neighbors

# Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers are linear classifiers that are known for being simple yet very efficient. The probabilistic model of naive Bayes classifiers is based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, and the adjective naive comes from the assumption that the features in a dataset are mutually independent. In
